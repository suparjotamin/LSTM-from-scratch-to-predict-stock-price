# LSTM-from-scratch-to-predict-stock-price

Collaboration with : Marcello Susanto

in this notebook, we create will do a prediction of stock price, Close price, of a certain stock by using RNN (Recurrence Neural Network). we will use LSTM. But, we create the LSTM model from scracth, only using numpy not from keras or TF. The purpose of this project is to understand fully about the computation in every neuron multiplication inside the LSTM. we will use only 1 layer of LSTM.
